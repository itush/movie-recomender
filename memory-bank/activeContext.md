# Active Context: Movie Recommender

## Current Work Focus
The Movie Recommender project is currently focused on implementing a content-based filtering model and deploying a simple Streamlit application.

## Recent Changes
- Set up the development environment with pipenv.
- Downloaded and explored the MovieLens dataset.
- Implemented a content-based filtering model using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.
- Created a Streamlit application to display movie recommendations.

## Next Steps
1. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the Streamlit application to a free hosting platform (e.g., Streamlit Cloud or Heroku).

2. **Documentation**:
    - Update the memory bank with the latest project status and deployment instructions.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- The project uses a content-based filtering approach for initial recommendations.
- Streamlit is used for rapid UI development and deployment.

### Open Questions
- How to improve the recommendation algorithm (e.g., by incorporating more features or using collaborative filtering)?
- What are the best practices for deploying Streamlit applications to free hosting platforms?

### Current Challenges
- Finding a reliable and free hosting platform for the Streamlit application.
- Ensuring the application is easily accessible and user-friendly.

## Integration Points
- **Movie Data**: Integration with the MovieLens dataset.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Content-based filtering model.
- **User Interface**: Streamlit web application.
