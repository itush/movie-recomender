# System Patterns: Movie Recommender

## Architecture Overview
The Movie Recommender follows a modern web application architecture with clear separation of concerns:

    Services <--> DB[(Database)]
    Services <--> External[External APIs]
```

## Key Components

### Frontend
- **Component-Based UI**: Using a component library for consistent UI elements
- **State Management**: Centralized state management for user preferences and application data
- **Responsive Design**: Fluid layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- **Client-Side Routing**: For seamless navigation without page reloads

### Backend
- **RESTful API**: Standardized endpoints for data retrieval and manipulation
- **Authentication Service**: Handles user registration, login, and session management
- **Recommendation Engine**: Core algorithm for generating personalized movie suggestions
- **Data Integration Layer**: Manages connections to external movie databases and APIs

### Database
- **User Data Store**: Stores user profiles, preferences, and interaction history
- **Movie Catalog**: Comprehensive database of movies with detailed metadata
- **Caching Layer**: Improves performance for frequently accessed data

## Design Patterns

### Frontend Patterns
- **Container/Presentational Pattern**: Separates data handling from UI rendering
- **Higher-Order Components**: For reusable functionality across components
- **Render Props**: For component composition and logic sharing
- **Custom Hooks**: For reusable stateful logic

### Backend Patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data access logic
- **Service Layer**: Encapsulates business logic
- **Dependency Injection**: For loose coupling between components
- **Middleware Pattern**: For request processing, authentication, and logging

### Data Patterns
- **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**: For structured data exchange between layers
- **Entity-Relationship Model**: For database schema design
- **Caching Strategy**: For optimizing frequently accessed data

## Component Relationships

### User Management Flow
```mermaid

    participant User
    participant AuthUI
    participant AuthService
    participant UserRepository
    
    User->>AuthUI: Register/Login
    AuthUI->>AuthService: Submit credentials
    AuthService->>UserRepository: Validate/Store user
    UserRepository-->>AuthService: User data
    AuthService-->>AuthUI: Authentication token
    AuthUI-->>User: Access granted
```

### Recommendation Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant RecommendationUI
    participant RecommendationService
    participant UserPreferenceService
    participant MovieDatabase
    
    User->>RecommendationUI: Request recommendations
    RecommendationUI->>RecommendationService: Get recommendations
    RecommendationService->>UserPreferenceService: Get user preferences
    UserPreferenceService-->>RecommendationService: User preference data
    RecommendationService->>MovieDatabase: Query movies
    MovieDatabase-->>RecommendationService: Movie data
    RecommendationService-->>RecommendationUI: Personalized recommendations
    RecommendationUI-->>User: Display recommendations
```

## Technical Decisions

### Frontend Framework Selection
The application uses a modern JavaScript framework/library for building interactive UIs with component-based architecture, efficient rendering, and robust state management.

### API Design
RESTful API design with JSON as the data exchange format, following standard HTTP methods and status codes for predictable behavior.

### Authentication Strategy
Token-based authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication and authorization.

### Database Selection
A combination of relational database for structured data (user profiles, movie metadata) and potentially NoSQL for handling recommendation algorithms and flexible data structures.
